# Mission_to_Mars

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a web application that will scrape new data on news revolving around the planet Mars, every time a user tells it to - with the click of a button. 

## Resources
- Data sources: https://data-class-mars.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html, https://data-class-jpl-space.s3.amazonaws.com/JPL_Space/index.html, https://marshemispheres.com/
- Software: Jupyter Notebook: 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2, MongoDB 5.0, Flask 2.0.2

## Results
Any user can use my web application to find the most recent news regarding the Red Planet. My website scrapes data from other news sources on Mars and then condenses and provides the information about the planet into a table. In said table, there exists a Mars column and an Earth column, with information about both celestial bodies printed next to one another, for easy-to-read comparisons.

Not only is this web application visible and usable on desktop, but it is tailored for mobile devices as well. The image below is a screenshot from a mobile phone's point of view.

Finally, I have included images from NASA and various other websites taken in outer space.
